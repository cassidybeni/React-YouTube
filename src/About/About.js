          Hello! My name is Cassidy Beni and I am a Web Developer from New York
          City. Currently, I am enrolled in the highly selective Pursuit
          fellowship for rising tech professionals and I am refining my
          technical and professional skills. I would like to improve the
          statistics of women of color in technology by contributing to this
          group's ability to network and grow in the tech industry. Iâ€™m a
          patient, resilient, and diligent web developer looking for
          opportunities to blend my career with my passions. I have experience
          in JavaScript, HTML and CSS as a full stack developer. I am passionate
          about music, fashion, and NBA, as well as, communication, teamwork,
          and problem-solving.
